Simple Genetic Algorithm
========================

This program was created as a part of an independent research course on Evolutionary Computation taken in the spring of 2015. The inspiration for this program is from chapter 2.2 of the text "Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithms" by Xinjie Yu.

This simple genetic algorithm is used to attempt to find a solution to the following optimization problem:

max f(x) = x * sin(10 * pi * x) + 2.0 s.t. -1 <= x <= 2

The curve of the above objective function is shown below:
